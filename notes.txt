### List of Data Structures
1. Static arrays
2. Dynamic arrays
3. Singly linked list
4. Dynamic linked list
5. Trees
6. Heaps -> which (I think) are a kind of tree 
7. Graph

### List of ADTs
1. List
2. Queue
3. Stack
4. Map


### 
There are many implementations of a heap:
    a. binay heap
    b. fibonacci heap
    c. binomial heap
    d. pairing heap

### Binary Heaps
-> Left child = 2i + 1
-> Right child = 2i + 2

For binary heaps implemented with an array.
